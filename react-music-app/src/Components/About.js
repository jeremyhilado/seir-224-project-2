                Hi, I'm Jeremy Hilado and this an app I created using the React framework.
                <br/> 
                It is a music themed app where users can search for an artist and then find
                <br/> 
                additional info related the user's search term such as biography, top tracks, 
                <br/>
                albums, and similar artists.
            </p>
        </div>
    )
}

export default About
