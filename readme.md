# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project 2: React
#### Overview

Let's kick it up a notch and build a modular and modern front end application using React!

Like with project one, the Unit 2 project is a chance to be creative and build something you should be proud of. You will be working individually for this project, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. 

You must submit your full project proposal to your squad leader by 10AM EST Friday.

Show us what you've got!

## Requirements

#### Your website must:
- Be a working, interactive, React application.
- Include data from a third-party API.
    - Pull data into the application using an API  
        [List of Public APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)  
        [More APIs](https://github.com/abhishekbanthia/Public-APIs)  
	[Instructor Recommended APIs](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-nyc-pirates/apis)
    - TRY OUT your API in the browser by making an fetch request before you get too emotionally invested in it, to make sure it works the way you think it does...**YOU ARE REQUIRED TO SHOW US YOU CAN RECEIVE THE DATA FOR YOUR PROPOSAL**
- Include React Router with at least 2 routes
- Have at least 5 separate components, using a readable file structure.
- Be built using Create React App.
- Built mobile first 
- Implement responsive design using flexbox, grid, or another css framework.
- Use React Hooks
- Be deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

#### Your code must:

- Be properly indented.  
- Be written with semantic, camelCase JavaScript variable names.  
- Be written with kebab-case (dashes) CSS class names.  
- Contain no `console.log()` or commented out code in final version.  
- Use only React for DOM manipulation.  
- No pre-loaded `create-react-app` files or code.

## Necessary Deliverables
#### A Professional README
- Refer to this [blog](https://medium.com/@meakaakka/a-beginners-guide-to-writing-a-kickass-readme-7ac01da88ab3) as a great resource on how to create a readme.

#### A Killer Project Proposal:
- Refer to the [project worksheet](/project-worksheet.md) file in this repo for structuring your Proposal.

#### For the project:
- A git repository hosted on GitHub, with a link to your hosted project, and **frequent** commits dating back to the very beginning of the project (YOUR APP SHOULD BE LOCATED IN A SEPARATE STANDING REPO. DO NOT build your app in this repository. YOU MUST initiate a new repo on your GitHub account.)

## Tips

* **Commit early, commit often.**  Don't be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.

## Getting Unstuck

* **Don't hesitate to write messy code to solve short-term problems**&mdash;***Refactor later***
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies you use**. The docs often include a tutorial that can help you get started, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer.

## Asking For Help

### In-person Support

Each student will be given 5 (five) tokens, redeemable at any time during regular
class and Study Hall time (not including evening Office hours), for 20 minutes
with an instructor. Tokens cannot be transferred between students - there is no
black market for tokens.

Instructors will not be holding open office hours during project week. This is
to give you the opportunity to solve issues and errors you run in to on your own
and with your classmates. Jared, however, will still hold his office hours as planned.

An instructor will be assigned to each team and wil check in with your team
every day for about 15 minutes. The purpose of these check-ins is not to
discuss technical questions, but to answer questions about workflow and get a status checkin.

#### Maximizing Effectiveness of Support Sessions

Prior to using one of your tokens, we ***strongly recommend*** that you file an issue on this repository in order to both provide the instructor with a point of reference regarding your code and the issue you are having. This will enable us to give you more effective guidance.

When you submit an issue please include the following:

  1. A code snippet
  2. A precise and specific description of your issue
  3. What error you got
  4. What you already tried to resolve your error and the result of those attempts

> [Check here for details on this process](https://github.com/ga-dc/wdi12/blob/master/asking-for-help.md#during-project-weeks).

We also strongly recommend **using Slack to get help from your classmates**. Chances are you all will be running into similar problems.

## A Note on Plagiarism

Take a moment to re-familiarize yourself with the [plagiarism policy](https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir-1118/Administrative/blob/master/plagiarism.md), specifically on using work you find online and on work you do with other students.
