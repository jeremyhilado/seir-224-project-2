# Presentations

**Each member of the group** must participate in the presentation.

Each presentation will be at most ten minutes long. Five minutes will then be allotted for questions from the class. Take turns answering questions during the Q & A. We suggest the following structure...

#### Introduction

- What's your app called?
- Who are your group members? Who had which responsibilities?
- Why is it useful? What is your "pitch"?

#### Demonstrating Your App

- What are the integral features of your app?

#### Demonstrating Your Code

- What was the most difficult part?
- What did you learn?
- What are you most proud of?

#### The Planning Process

- How did you arrive at this idea?
- How did you decide who would have which responsibilities?
- What would you change about your planning process?

#### The Week

- What was your week like?  
- Did you feel the Emotional Cycle of Change?
- How did you work together?

#### Highs and Lows

- What worked well?
- What didn't?
- What features would you like to add?
